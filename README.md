<h1> Gemini Orchestra Framework </h1>

<h2>What is this</h2>
  <p>This is a pre-built framwork you can custimize to liking to meet the project requirements. Today's expectations with AI agents are over tge moon, using this framework will make that easier and help you understand how this work that you can build your own framework or AI agent</p>

<h2>How to install</h2>
I will move this to a package when the orchestra is in a working state.

<h2>Architecture</h2>
The core agents consits of:
  </br><li>Orchestrator - Decides what is needed to complete the task</li>
  <li>Summary Man - Makes summarizes to assit LLM to keep on topic</li>
  <li>Tool Handeler - Decides what tool is needed to call (this is for custom tool)</li>
  <li>Builder - Build the final response</li>
  <li>Proof Reader - Makes sure the wording is correct</li></br>

I am considering to build a custom RAG system that can adapt to its knowledge base, that is still in planning how to execute it.
